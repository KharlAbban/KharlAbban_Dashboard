Current Problems with eating out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Food is yet to be cooked
Food is still cooking or is not ready
There are a lot of people to be served
There are few waiters/waitresses
There might be a long queue
Food takes a long time after ordering
Long wait time before you can pay for your food
The prices of the foods might not be known or clearly stated
The business wastes a lot of money if they want to update their menu(especially big restaurants), since they have to reprint the whole menu
Customers cannot see the menu beforehand, eg. at the reception
Pressure on cook when there are many orders, i.e he has to review them manually

Benefits of the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To address the most important and crucial problems stated above.
Mainly to speed up ordering and payment.
Customers can relax, and socialise without worrying about thier bill
Creation of a "locally hosted"(under consideration) web app for a restaurant/food service business.
The web app's main aim is to fix the above stated problems.
Businesses must be able to easily modify their menu, choose accepted payment methods, customise QR Code.
Businesses can choose to store customer data, payment info, general info, etc.

Features the project can have
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Integration with various banks and mobile telecom companies, eg. GCB, ABSA, MTN, Vodafone, etc
Businesses can customise the QR code with their own logo or brand
Menu should display new items, menu updates, and promotions
Payment option should be static until order has been paid for
On scanning, each device could be given a unique ID and can be used to record customer details(name, number)
The unique ID could expire and log out the customer some time after paying, maybe 2 minutes after paying
The customer must not have access after leaving the premises
Can remember the customer when they come next time
Real-time order status
See food status: out-of-stock, in-stock, being cooked, not available, etc
Should be able to handle multiple users well
Rate foods or see ratings by other customers
Kitchen or admin can send out a notice to the customers through the menu, eg. to expect delays
Grey out or blank out food not available or finished(add a notice that its finished)
See wait time for food ordered
Admin should be able to tell who has finished paying, who has not and current customer status
Menu should allow you to change your order
Re-order after paying or eating
Recognize users who have not paid but have stepped out temporarily

These are some ideas I thought about after reviewing the project. Most of the features
are ones that will likely be implemented later. I added them to broaden our view. Please look
through. I added plenty things too so please feel free to summarise what we'll NEED NOW, so
we can start work on those ones. If you guys have any more ideas, please add them or make a list.
I will also speak to others about some challenges they face while eating out so we can have
more info.

Thank you!
